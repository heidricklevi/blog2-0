	            	<p>
	            		Hello!
	            		My name is Levi, I am the creator of this site. I am currently a student at The University of Kansas.
                        I am in their engineering program for Information Technology of which I have about one year left!
                        I am extremely passionate about technology. From building my own machine to deploying my own code to an EC2 instance
                        - I love it all!

                    <h2 style="font-weight: 700; margin-bottom: 5px;">My passion</h2>
                    <p style="padding-bottom: 5%">I am driven by my passion for technology and eagerness to learn.
                        Software facilitates and accommodates our everyday lives allowing convenience, communication, and advancements in
                        nearly every field and area of our lives imaginable. Of course, we can't mention software without mentioning the
                        hardware it runs on top of. Software could not exist without its accompanying hardware. When I think about computer
                        architecture at a lower level, I think about how it interprets all the code several abstraction layers above it.
                        The language of the physical hardware is binary, and it can only represent one of two states. This relatively simple
                        form of Boolean logic is at the base of computers, circuits, and electronics in general. It is truly fascinating to
                        think about every time I see the result of these systems and what is possible that it is all built on top of this
                        seemingly simple logic. I find it intriguing, fascinating, and extremely enjoyable to create software and immerse
                        myself in this technology on a daily basis. This is definitely something I want to be a part of.
                    </p>


                    <h2 style="font-weight: 700; margin-bottom: 5px;">Why I created this site</h2>
                    <p style="padding-bottom: 5%">I built this site to help facilitate my learning and hopefully help other people learn as well.
                        I wanted to learn more about the fascinating web, and the tech that powers it. That is why I built this application from scratch.
                        I am hoping to turn this site into much more than a blog, but I think that is my best starting point. The blog will mainly consist
                        of my experiences and roadblocks while building software and also some tips, tricks, and HOW-TO's.
                    </p>
